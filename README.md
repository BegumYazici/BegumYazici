🚀 I'm keen on Android, Kotlin and new technologies so I would like to learn more! 🤓

🌟 After discovering my passion for Android development, I decided to study a lot 📚 and I taught myself all about Android development

🔭 I’m currently working on a legacy app to migrate kotlin androidx to make it ready for play store requirements
